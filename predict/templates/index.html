        <p>The Glicko rating system and Glicko-2 rating system are methods of assessing a player's strength in games of skill, such as chess and Go. The Glicko rating system was invented by Mark Glickman in 1995 as an improvement on the Elo rating system, and initially intended for the primary use as a chess rating system. Glickman's principal contribution to measurement is "ratings reliability", called RD, for ratings deviation.</p>
        <br>
        <p>this site applies the Glicko-2 rating system to the NBA.</p>
        <p>rating is a measure of a team's strength, higher = better.</p>
        <p>RD is a measure of the uncertainty of a team's rating.</p>
        <p>volatility is a measure of the uncertainty of a team's RD.</p>
